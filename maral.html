         <p class="text-justify">We moved to Armenia three years ago, as a result of the ongoing war in Syria. I love Armenia, and I have always considered as my motherland, but the only problem is unemployment. I have two sons and both of them work for a minimum wage that does not pay anything at all.  A year ago, I tried to seek asylum in Sweden, but the men who organized the trip tricked us, they turned out to be human traffickers who lied and stole everything we had. The minute we landed in Montenegro, which was supposed to be the last stop before arriving to Sweden, I was immediately arrested, since the visas that the traffickers had provided us were fake and illegal. <br /> <br /> I was imprisoned for a whole month, alone in a country where I had neither friends nor relatives. A country that humiliated me just for seeking refuge. Then, after the horrible month, I was finally released and sent back to Armenia. Since then, I have realized that my only safe haven is Armenia. However, I truly wish for the war to finish in Syria so that I could go back and actually live, instead of just existing. After all, I was born and married in Syria, and anywhere you go around the world, you could never find a place like Syria.</p>
