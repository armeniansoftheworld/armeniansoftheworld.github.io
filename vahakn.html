         <p class="text-justify">I started to swim when I was five years old. I had a friend who was going to swimming classes and he was a year older than me. He teased me a lot telling me that "Everyone who turns five should start swimming" and as a result he made me very jealous. When my parents asked me what I wanted for my birthday I told them that I want to go swimming, they kept their promise and my father started taking me to swimming classes. One of the problems that Armenian professional swimmers face in Armenia is the army, before I went to the army I was the best Swimmer in all competitions even during participating in a tournament in Europe I came out third, but as you can see now for the first time after serving in the army I lost all my distances in the local competition here in Armenia.<br /> <br />
 My dream is to make swimming a mainstream sport in Armenia because many people say that swimming is not a sport made for Armenians, but I do not understand, how come Armenians can be great in wrestling and weightlifting but not be good at swimming? It is all about the desire in my opinion. My current short term goal is to get accepted into the American University of Armenia because I have heard that you have a lot of good professors and the BA diploma is very credible as well.
