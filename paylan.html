         <p class="text-justify">I will forever bow in respect to the memory of my ancestors who became martyrs, who survived despite the odds and who reshaped the Armenian nation’s reality. I personally believe that Turkey, with the help of its revolutionary citizens, will soon enter a period of democratization. Turkey’s government must face the bloody history of their ancestors. They neglect my claims by giving the same response over and over again, “leave the history for the historians.” But how can I forget the history of my family? How can I ignore the 1.5 million souls who are still awaiting for a decent and just destiny? <br /> <br />
I firmly believe that to face the reality, is to heal. And accepting the Armenian Genocide and compensating the Armenian nation will be the first step among many others which will serve justice, not only to Armenians, but other minorities that are still facing discrimination and witnessing massacres till this very day. Today, the basic rights of citizens are being violated on a daily basis. However, I consider myself fortunate enough to have a platform that enables me to voice the concerns and sufferings of my fellow countrymen. I know that I have been silenced, suspended and even attacked for my opinions. But, I will always fight for my cause, and I will forever speak up for my brothers and sisters, even if it eventually costs my life.</p>
