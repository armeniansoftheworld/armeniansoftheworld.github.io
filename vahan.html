         <p class="text-justify">Although I was born in Aleppo, Syria. I was raised in a village called Al-Safita. In our village, you rarely met any Muslims, we were all Christian Arabs. I moved to Armenia three years ago with my brother, since we had to escape the country in order not to serve in the military, because it was and still is very dangerous to serve in the Syrian army, especially during wartime. We could not travel to Armenia by airplane, therefore we had to take the bus, travel to Lebanon where we were constantly discriminated against just for being Syrians and from Lebanon, we travelled to Yerevan via Dubai. <br /> <br />
 The road to Lebanon was very dangerous but we had to take the risk, The bus that was in front of us was attacked by rebel ‘moderate’ forces, three people were killed that day, but we had to continue our journey because of our fear of  further potential attacks. Ever since that day, I decided to be optimistic towards life, just like the saying "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." Although we would love to go back to Syria one day, we cannot complain of our lives here in Yerevan, my brother and I are employed and we have a above our heads, which is way more than what millions of Syrians wish for nowadays, so I can only say "Alhamdulillah" (Thank God)
