         <p class="text-justify">After the murder, a sense of guiltiness started to haunt me. I started to constantly question myself: Was it my fault that I never held him back from speaking the truth? Would I be able to prevent this horrible reality if I have said ‘enough’ or even completely stopped him? I believe that these questions will haunt me till my very last day on this earth.<br /><br />
Now, I am standing here, witnessing a new revolution in the eyes of my brothers and sisters, but I am exhausted from grief and sorrow. I am standing here, crying my eyes out for my love, Hrant. My soul is wailing for the innocent lives that my Armenian nation has lost in 1915, and my bitter tears are for the humanity, its terrible mistakes and unjust policies. <br /><br />
My child, I am ashamed, as I observe my country. I let my voice echo as loud as possible, yet my country is not willing to change. It is still corrupt, unjust and wounded. However, my faith in my countrymen is stronger than ever. If we unite as a nation, our hearts will unite as well. Our scars will be healed, and we will welcome our promising future. We will cast aside the rotten mentality and my people will become pure. After all, I promised to continue the legacy of my love, Hrant. How he boldly talked about his beliefs. He never disgraded his encounters, instead he loved them and he tried his best to awaken their consciousness. My love, my friend and my husband has been physically absent for 10 years now. However, his spirit, his ideas, and his work will never leave the hearts and souls of his family and fellow countrymen.
